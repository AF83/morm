Morm is an attempt to create a nice and as powerfull as possible PHP orm.

For now, Morm can handle:

* Simple Object -> Table mapping
* one to one relations
* one to manu relations
* many to many relations (still in early alpha stage though)
* polymorphism
* other things I don't remember right now


Fell free to ask for improvements
