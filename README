Morm is an attempt to create a nice and as powerfull as possible PHP orm.

For now, Morm can handle:

* Simple Object -> Table mapping
* one to one relations
* one to many relations
* many to many relations (still in early alpha stage though)
* polymorphism
* other things I don't remember right now

don't expect things to work as is for now.
I'll try to update things to make it easily usable as soon as possible.

Fell free to ask for improvements
